# Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation Policy

- **Only create documentation that is important enough to be written to the README.md**
- **You ARE allow to edit the .env and .env.example files in the project to add env variables**
- **Do NOT create new markdown files for every code addition or feature**
- **Do NOT create separate documentation files unless explicitly requested**

When generating code, documentation should be:
- Minimal and purposeful
- Added to README.md only when it provides significant value to users
- Focused on setup, configuration, and critical usage information
- Avoided for routine code additions, minor features, or internal implementation details

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and inline comments where necessary, rather than generating separate documentation files.
